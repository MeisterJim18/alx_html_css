# Get Schooled

This project is part of my learning journey into web development. It focuses on the basics of HTML and CSS, helping me understand how to structure a webpage and style it using simple rules. The goal is to get comfortable with creating files, organizing folders, and writing clean, readable code.

"Get Schooled" is about building a strong foundation. Through this project, I’m practicing essential skills that will support more advanced web projects in the future. It’s a first step toward becoming confident and efficient in front-end development.
